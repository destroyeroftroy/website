# Frequently Asked Questions

### How does topic selection work?

We'll announce a topic during the keynote speech (6PM on the 2nd).

### How does team formation work?
	
Teams can be formed ahead of time or at the event; no formal ahead-of-time team registration is required.

### What type of project deliverable is expected? Is the deliverable a presentation about what you built, or is is just the thing that you built?
	
During primary judging (2:00PM-4:30PM on the 3rd), the judges will walk around and score projects. The top 10 teams or individuals are then notified that they've been selected for the final judging. They produce a presentation, which is presented to the judges and all competitors.
		
### Will we be allowed to talk to judges about our project in a two-way conversation?

Both primary and final judging are both fairly interactive; primary more so due to the smaller-scale interaction.

### Will there be multiple categories for prizes?
	
Yes, although I can't speak to what they are. Last year, I know they included a bunch of AWS credit for the best AWS-using project. In general, I'd highly recommend seeing what categories your project could fit into a couple hours before submitting it -- I'm still kicking myself over not applying for the AWS category when I competed last year.

### Will the size of the team be considered (higher expectations for bigger teams)?
	
No. Furthermore, each team member receives the same prize an individual would if the team wins. Last year, the first, second, and third place competitors were all teams, so I'd advise teaming up!

### Your website says come with ideas.  Is there a general topic or theme, or is it anything?
	
There will be a theme announced.

### Is there a list of people who are looking for teammates, or any sort of built-in pairing mechanism?
	
We'll also announce a Discord at the keynote speech; there's a channel there for finding teammates.

# Travel Reimbursement FAQs:

### Will you be providing travel reimbursements this year?

**YES!** We are able to provide travel reimbursements. Email [acm@umn.edu](mailto:acm@umn.edu) *ahead of time* to request a reimbursement and be sure to save your receipts.

We will also be providing buses to Madison, Urbana Champaign, and Purdue. If you're interested in being one of the bus captains this year, please contact us at [acm@umn.edu](mailto:acm@umn.edu).

### Can I get reimbursement if I live outside the United States?

Unfortunately, no. We will need a US mailing address to send you the reimbursement. You can work around this if you have someone who lives in the United States and can receive mail for you, but their address needs to be the one you put on the travel reimbursement request.

### How much reimbursement can I receive?

Historically we have only given individuals up to $100 in reimbursement. We will consider reimbursement requests above this, but requests above $100 may not receive the full amount. We will be prioritising those with higher need for reimbursement as well as people who make an effort to lower the cost of travel.

### Do I need to request reimbursement if I plan on taking one of the busses you are sending?

Nope, we are covering all the costs for the busses we are sending. You only need to request reimbursement if you are taking a bus that we are not sending.

### Where are you sending busses?

We are still figuring out where we are sending busses this year. We will definitely be sending a bus to Madison, WI. We will likely be sending busses to Purdue, and the University of Illinous Urbana Champaign. If you are interested in being a bus captain, please contact us and let us know. If you are at Purdue or UIUC and would like us to confirm that we are sending a bus to you, please contact us. 

### Am I guaranteed reimbursement?

No, we are not able to guarantee reimbursement until after the event is complete. To receive reimbursement you must attend the event and have a US mailing address. You must also request your reimbursement before the end of the event. Reimbursement requests that are sent sooner will be given higher priority than those sent later.

### By what criteria will you be approving the requests?

We will be prioritizing people who have higher need for reimbursement, as well as those who make a clear effort to lower the cost of travel. We are more likely to approve requests under $100, but will consider requests above it.

### How will I know if my request has been approved?

One week after MinneHack we will be emailing everyone whose request has been approved with the steps they need to follow to receive their reimbursement.
